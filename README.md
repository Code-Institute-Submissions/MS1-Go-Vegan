## Introductions to my Project <a name="introduction"></a>
My project is to help people transition to vegan, it is to encourage someone to take the first step in the journey to a more sustainable, compasionate healthy lifestyle.

If you are curious about what going Vegan means? Then my website will help with motivation and reasons why going vegan is the best choose you can make for 
the animals, the planet and your health.

And if you need help in your transition, let me support you, just join my go vegan challange.

## UX <a name="ux"></a>
For full UX document please see [MS1 UX Design Document](https://github.com/nikkikobako/MS1-Go-Vegan/blob/master/assets/documentation/How%20to%20go%20Vegan.pdf)

### Website Goals <a name="webgoal"></a>

* An informative website to encourage people to transition to vegan
* Easy to use to help, not hinder a transition
* Ability to get in touch for more help


### User Stories for How to go Vegan <a name="userstory"></a>

* As a user I can see what being vegan means before I decide to convert
* As a user I can get help and support to transition to vegan so I am not doing it on my own
* As a user I want to investigate the reasons why someone becomes vegan
* As a user I am curious about what veganism is and what it involves
* As a user I want some inspiration of what I can cook 

### My Wireframes <a name="wireframe"></a>
I used Balsamiq Wireframes to create my Wireframes. They include 4 mobile pages, 
4 desktop pages and 1 for tablet as all other tablet views are the same as desktop.

#### Amendments to Wireframes
Since creating the wireframes, as part of testing I have amended to improve the user experiance as follows
* For the large screen recipe page I amended to have 2 recipes per row, as the page looked very empty
* For all sizes for the why go vegan page I have renoved the scroll option for the text 
* For the tablet screen why go vegan page I have amended to the same as mobile 1 column width as the screen looked to crowded
* For the XL screen on the why page I added collapsable buttons as the text was different sizes

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

* CSS - Used to style the content into a user friendly version
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Used to write my html and CSS and to store my images, recipes, documentation and wireframes
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Used to version control my website, store the commited code and deploy my website to live
* [Bootstrap framwork including JQuery](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to help help ensure mbile first approach used and to style content for different media devices

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
?????In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, 
in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, 
link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:



Testing has been completed using the following

1. Initial testing was via gitpod and the developer tool inspect to show my pages as mobile, tablet and full screen
2. The code was then published via git hub and tested on the following devices
    1. Samsung S8 mobile phone
    2. Samsung Galaxy S2 tablet
    3. Oukitel C15 Pro mobile phone
    4. iMac desktop
    5. Microsoft surface Pro
    6. Browser Chrome
3. The code was shared on Slack for testing by the community
4. Each html and css was ran through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure no errors

### Tests completed
1. 
????Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

????You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

????If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

### Project Creation
Go Vegan project was created via GitHub using the CodeInstitue template to then open in GitPod. All coding was done in GitPod and pushed back to GitHub 
for storage and version control using the "git add." followed by "git commit -m" and finally the "git push" command. On this occasion I did not use any 
branching, I only used the master for version control.

### Project Deployment to Live
Once I reached the stage of wanting to test on mobile and tablet I then published my webiste to live using GitHub via the following steps

1. Open my GitHub project [MS1 Go Vegan](https://github.com/nikkikobako/MS1-Go-Vegan)
2. Go to Settings
3. Scroll down until reach the section GitHub Pages
4. Change the branch option from none to master and saved
5. This then gave me a live website [Go Vegan](https://nikkikobako.github.io/MS1-Go-Vegan/)
